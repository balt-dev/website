**Pronouns** he/him

**Sex** Male

**Age** 162

**Height** 6'7"

**Species** <img src="assets/supervisor.gif"></img> Fofo

The lab supervisor. Old-fashioned, with some dated beliefs. Never liked Gale.

## Backstory

It was a regular day at the lab. Gale was testing out a new word they'd recently synthesized, "MERGE". 

This word had the peculiar property of creating entirely new objects by combining other objects!

This kind of behavior had never been seen before in a property, so the supervisor was quick to try to capitalize on it.

The lab had gotten access to a baba cadaver recently, who had donated their body to science.

It was getting late, and Gale didn't want to set up the proper rule,
so a quick <img src="./rule.gif" alt="THIS IS MERGE"></img> on it would be fine, right?

Just had to be careful...

---

Gale banged its neck on the cabinet. A belt falls from the top shelf. Uh-oh.

A voice comes from the baba - or, what used to be a baba? "Huh? Where am I?"

Gale is stunned. Had she just revived someone from the dead?
No, that's impossible, the belt wasn't alive, they'd only be... half-dead.

"Hey! What's going on? Where am I? What am I? Why can't I remember anything?"

Gale hits the panic button, shutting off all rules in the vicinity. Big mistake.

A guard enters the room and is stunned. Gale tries to explain,
but before it can get a sentence out, the new creature stands up.

"Okay, judging by your lab coat, that '<img src="assets/merge.gif" alt="MERGE"></img>' rule,
the fact that there's a ton of random shit on the ground next to me,
and among that is a *cadaver tag for a baba*...

did you just fuck up a lab experiment?"

Gale eeks out a slight "...yeah".

"Hah, no shit! You basically saved my life, thank y-"

The guard shoots them with a tranquilizer. It bounces off the metal.

---

Gale sits in front of the supervisor.

"Look, we can't let this get to the public. It has to go."

"Why!? Balt just got a second chance at life-"

"That *abomination* is not alive. Your career is already over. Don't make this harder than it has to be."

Being carried towards the incinerator, Balt looks back at the only one that ever cared for them.

---

Gale's home. A tiny apartment - this job never paid that well anyway, surely she can find a better place to apply her skills.

They weren't an abomination. They were alive, just like her. They were a person, just like her.

Getting out of the shower, Gale notices something in the mirror. Maybe it was a trick of the light,
but it could've sworn it saw the arrow of a belt.

Gale can't sleep. It feels like it's being watched. She's not afraid of the dark, she grew out of that!

...something moved. Something fucking moved. What the fuck. That's Balt.
What's going on. Is she dreaming? She has to be, this can't be real. Why can't she wake up?
Her eyes are already open. This is real. Oh gods. She's going insane. There's no way.
She's hallucinating. No. No. No. What? How? How is this real? They died in the lab!
She saw them get incinerated! How are they alive? They're not, they're a ghost!
But ghosts aren't real! They're just some fairytale, some coping mechanism-

"...Gale?"

It freezes in place.

"Oh thank the gods I finally got through to you."

This is real. They're real.

"Look, I know it's late, but I can't stay without a body like this. I saw you have a 3D printer-"

Gale bolts out of bed. It's 3:40 AM. She doesn't care. This is too important.
It opens Blender and starts sculpting.

---

> "How does having a 3D-printed body feel?"

"Honestly, this body's pretty good! Feels a little clunky, but I can get used to it."

> "Did the lab fire you because of your gender?"

"No comment."

> "Can you see other ghosts?"

"No. I'm only a half-ghost. I can tell they're there, but I can't see anyone."

> "What's your plan for a new job?"

"Electronics engineering. I minored in it."

> "What's _your_ plan?"

"I haven't decided yet."

> "And we're out of time. Thank you for Gale and Balt for coming to this exclusive interview, on PRTV News, channel 7. Now, the weather."

## Side Characters and Events

### Sunbad <img src="assets/sunbad.png"></img>

Due to yet another rule experiment gone wrong, somehow, in some way,
a Badbad who was <img src="assets/merge.gif" alt="MERGE"></img>
ended up getting teleported into the core of the sun. 

And merged with it.

She can see what's going on, and will not hesitate to smite people she deems
to be bad people. She's ended wars in the past.
