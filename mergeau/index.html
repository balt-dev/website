			</p>
			<p>The lab supervisor. Old-fashioned, with some dated beliefs. Never
				liked Gale.
			</p>
			<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
			<p>It was a regular day at the lab. Gale was testing out a new word
				they'd recently synthesized, <img src="assets/merge.gif" alt="MERGE"></img>.
			</p>
			<p>This word had the peculiar property of creating entirely new objects
				by combining other objects!
			</p>
			<p>This kind of behavior had never been seen before in a property, so
				the supervisor was quick to try to capitalize on it.
			</p>
			<p>The lab had gotten access to a baba cadaver recently, who had donated
				their body to science.
			</p>
			<p>It was getting late, and Gale didn't want to set up the proper rule,
				so a quick <img src="assets/rule.gif" style="min-height: 30px;" alt="THIS IS MERGE"></img> on it would
				be fine, right?
			</p>
			<p>Just had to be careful...</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Gale bangs its neck on the cabinet. A belt falls from the top shelf.
				Uh-oh.
			</p>
			<p>A voice comes from the baba - or, what used to be a baba? <span class="balt">"Huh? Where
				am I?"</span>
			</p>
			<p>Gale is stunned. Had she just revived someone from the dead? No,
				that's impossible, the belt wasn't alive!
			</p>
			<p><span class="balt"> "Hey! What's going on? Where am I? What am I? Why can't I remember
				anything?"</span>
			</p>
			<p>Gale hits the panic button, shutting off all rules in the vicinity.
				Big mistake.
			</p>
			<p>A guard enters the room and is stunned. Gale tries to explain, but
				before it can get a sentence out, the new creature stands up.
			</p>
			<p> <span class="balt"> "Okay, judging by your lab coat, that
				<img src="assets/merge.gif" alt="MERGE"></img> rule, the fact that
				there's a ton of random shit on the ground next to me, and among that is
				a <em>cadaver tag for a baba</em>... </span>
			</p>
			<p> <span class="balt"> did you just fuck up a lab experiment?" </span></p>
			<p>Gale eeks out a slight <span class="gale"> "...yeah." </span></p>
			<p> <span class="balt"> "Hah, no shit! You basically saved my life, thank y-" </span> </p>
			<p>The guard shoots them with a tranquilizer. It bounces off the
				metal.
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p> <span class="supervisor"> "Look, we can't let this get to the public. It has to go. It's standard procedure." </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="gale"> "Why!? Balt just got a second chance at life-" </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="supervisor"> "That <em>abomination</em> is not alive. Don't make this harder than it has to be." </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="gale"> "Why wouldn't they be alive? Give them a chance, please!" </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="supervisor"> "Something that fucked-up looking can't be. My god wouldn't allow it." </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="gale"> "Of course it circles back to your god. You know there's more than one pea in a pod?" </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="supervisor"> "...hand over your name tag. I'm done with you and your woke ideas." </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="gale"> "Wh- You can't just do that! It's against state law!" </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="supervisor"> "<strong>TAG. ON MY DESK. OUT THE DOOR. NOW.</strong>" </span> </p>
			<p> <span class="gale"> "...fine. Fine. You know what? Fine. Go ahead and commit murder for the sake of some 'cover-up'. Fuck you." </span> </p>
			<p> With a huff, Gale exits the supervisor's office and gathers its things. </p>
			<hr />
			<p>Gale gets home. A tiny apartment - this job never paid that well anyway,
				surely she can find a better place to apply her skills.
			</p>
			<p>They weren't an abomination. They were alive, just like her. They
				were a person, just like her.
			</p>
			<p>Getting out of the shower, Gale notices something in the mirror.
				Maybe it was a trick of the light, but it could've sworn it saw the
				arrow of a belt.
			</p>
			<p>Gale can't sleep. It feels like it's being watched. She's not afraid
				of the dark, she grew out of that!
			</p>
			<p>...something moved. Something fucking moved. What the fuck. That's
				Balt. What's going on. Is it dreaming? It has to be, this can't be
				real. Why can't she wake up? Its eyes are already open. This is real. Oh
				gods. It's going insane. There's no way. She's hallucinating.
				No. No. No. What? How? How is this real? They died in the lab! It saw
				them get incinerated! How are they alive? They're not, they're a ghost!
				But ghosts aren't real! She knows ghosts aren't real!
				They're just some fairytale, some coping mechanism-
			</p>
			<p> <span class="balt"> "...Gale?" </span> </p>
			<p>It freezes in place.</p>
			<p> <span class="balt"> "Oh thank the gods I finally got through to you." </span> </p>
			<p>This is real. They're real.</p>
			<p> <span class="balt"> "Look, I know it's late, but I can't stay without a body like this. I
				saw you have a 3D printer-" </span>
			</p>
			<p>Gale bolts out of bed. It's 3:40 AM. It doesn't care. This is too
				important. It opens Blender and starts sculpting.
			</p>
			<hr />
			<blockquote class="interviewer">
				<p><i>"How did it feel having a 3D-printed body?"</i></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><span class="balt"> "Bad. The plastic kept grating against itself and made it really <span class="redacted">fucking</span> hard to walk. I am VERY glad to have this metal one now, hah."</span>
			</p>
			<blockquote class="interviewer">
				<p><i>"Do you plan on pressing charges against the-"</i></p>

			<p> <span class="balt"> "Yes. <span class="redacted">Fuck</span> yes. Do you <i>realize</i> how traumatic being put through a <span class="redacted">fucking</span> car crusher is?

I mean, <span class="redacted">fuck</span>, I <i>still</i> get nightmares. Those lab <span class="redacted">shitheads</span> need to go to jail.

			<p class="small"><span class="camera_crew">"Hey, cool it on the language, please. We're on air."</span></p>
			<p class="small"><span class="balt">"Sorry. Just... a touchy topic."</span></p>

			<p> <span class="balt"> "No, again, I'm only a half-ghost. I can tell they're there, but I can't see
				anyone." </span>
			</p>
			<blockquote class="interviewer">
				<p><i>"Do you remember what life was like before this happened to you?"</i></p>

			<p> <span class="balt"> "Nope, nothing. It's completely blank. From what I hear, though, it's probably for the best." </span> </p>

			<p> <span class="balt"> "<span class="redacted">Fuck</span> if I know. I don't need to eat, or be warm, or anything that costs money, so I'm in no rush." </span> </p>

			<h3 id="sunbad">Sunbad <img src="assets/sunbad.gif"></img></h3>
			<p>Due to yet another rule experiment gone wrong, somehow, in some way,
				a Badbad who was <img src="assets/merge.gif" alt="MERGE"></img> ended up
				getting teleported into the core of the sun...
			</p>
			<p>...and merged with it.</p>
