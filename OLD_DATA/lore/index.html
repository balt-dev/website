      Merge AU
    </h1>

    <hr />

    <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>

    <p>
      Merge AU takes place inside a world not unlike Earth, where all main
      characters in Baba Is You are genuses.<br>All of these coexist, and there
      is a similar society to modern day.<br>This is not post-scarcity, and why
      that is will be explained later.
    </p>

    <h1 id="story">Story</h1>

    <h2 id="jiji">Jiji</h2>

    <p>Our story starts with Jiji.</p>

    <p>
      Nameless by choice, going only by Jiji, they started out living on the
      streets.<br>Being born intersex at a hatefully exclusionary time and place,
      they were outcast from their potential life.<br>Their parents kicked them
      out to the streets at a very, very young age, and this left an impression
      on them.<br>They were gifted with their extreme charm and universal
      expertise, and if not for this, may have changed the world forever.<br>They
      started out in their preteen years already high-ranking among local gangs,
     <br>and by the time they started to mature, they were already a well-known
      and feared criminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around that time, they discovered their affinity for TEXT and manipulation
      of it.<br>In using these skills, they turned themself from the local
      mafia&rsquo;s leader to a world-feared villain.<br>They committed countless
      atrocities, including arson, <span class="redacted">xxxx xxxx</span>, torture, and
      massacre, to name a few.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, Jiji grew tired of their leadership position, and moved on to
      their own ideas.<br>Working alone out of insanity, they grew to understand
      how TEXT was created, and how to make their own.<br>One of their first and
      only experiments with this custom text was MERGE, which is where Balt
      comes into play.
    </p>

    <h2 id="balt">Balt</h2>

    <p>
      Balt was created via the merging of a Baba and a Belt.<br>Due to a fault in
      Jiji&rsquo;s programming of MERGE, however, this was incorrectly handled.
     <br>Instead of keeping the soul of the Baba and transforming it, the
      existing soul was expunged into the afterlife immediately,<br>and a new,
      similar soul was created in its place, without more than memory of what
      the world is and the essentials to live in it.<br>Balt immediately ran from
      Jiji&rsquo;s workshop, but without anywhere to go, returned less than a
      quarter hour later.<br>Jiji, however, was massively affected by this, as
      the shockwave from the creation of this new soul had altered theirs as well.
      <br>After a few hours, Jiji woke up, and realized the horror of what they
      had done, and only wanted to atone.<br>They gave Balt a few lessons on the
      world, a sum of money to start their life, and went to turn themselves in.
    </p>

    <h2 id="judgement">Judgement</h2>

    <p>
      Jiji had set something up so that they could physically not be killed, so
      the local government compromised with them,<br>meaning Jiji lived out their
      entire sentence under a purgatorial medically-induced dream state.<br>
      Jiji&rsquo;s full sentence was around 250 millenia after tallying all
      known crimes up, leaving Jiji in a dream state for 7 years.<br>In these 7
      years, Balt started out a new life, making friends, enemies, living their
      life to the fullest.<br>He started out working odd jobs to pay the rent,
      but eventually got a career in biosimulation and its applications for
      virtual reality.<br>Balt made massive progress in the field, pioneering the
      SR (simulated reality) genre of games along with his team.
    </p>

    <h2 id="amalgam">Amalgam</h2>

    <p>
      After their release, Jiji was extremely shaken up, as they had lost most
      of their memory,<br>and only had what they had written down beforehand to
      go off of.<br>They sought out Balt, and he caught them up to speed on what
      had changed, and what he knew they knew.<br>Using this knowledge, Jiji
      started out with their experiments again (under governmental eye),<br>and
      isolated a serum that could temporarily merge two objects without TEXT,
      and if applicable, while keeping their souls intact.<br>After a few
      isolated experiments, Jiji decided to ask around for volunteers to create
      an amalgam and run tests on its stability.<br>During this testing, however,
      Balt fell in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without proper preparation beforehand, Balt was instantly killed, and his
      body amalgamated.<br>Normally, most people are forced into the afterlife
      after only a few minutes,<br>and most don&rsquo;t have time to learn how to
      interact with the world as a ghost, but Balt was an exception.<br>Due to
      Jiji&rsquo;s improper handling of merge years prior, he isn&rsquo;t able
      to move on to the afterlife yet.<br>Since his soul was created artificially
      and without an ID, he can&rsquo;t move on until everyone else has - <br>that
      is, he has to wait for armageddon.<br>After being calmed from a panic
      attack by Balt, Jiji aborted the experiment early and sent everyone home.
     <br>Balt decided not to press charges, as it was a tragic accident caused by
      his mistake.<br>However, after a bit of learning, he could still work, and
      talk, and everything else as a ghost,<br>making it <em>almost</em>,
      <em><strong>almost</strong></em> as if he had never died.
    </p>

    <h2 id="post-death">Post-death</h2>

    <p>
      After getting back on his feet, keeping his job, Balt decided he was sick
      of not having a body.<br>Working with Jiji for the more strenuous parts,
      <br>Balt created a mechanical, soul-driven body to inhabit, with very similar
      looks to his old one.<br>Made from metal and rubber, Balt enjoyed being in
      this body, as it made him feel secure,<br>but he felt there was some things
      he could not do.<br>After a few months of working alone (Jiji had their own
      things to do), Balt had created a few more bodies:
      <ul>
        <li>One to swim effectively, allowing him to enjoy the sea</li>
        <li>One to fly himself at high speed through the air
          (given FCC clearance, of course)</li>
        <li>One to withstandthe hottest of temperatures, 
          able to sit in hot lava and be fine</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Balt no longer had to pay for groceries or water bills, as he no longer
      needed them, which set him ahead in finances.<br>This let him collect his
      income much more effectively, and live a little large.<br>However, he
      realized that he hates living lavishly, and would rather stay small,<br>so he
      picked up and moved to an apartment-sized house near Jiji&rsquo;s.<br>They
      visit each other often.
    </p>

    <h2 id="present-day">Present Day</h2>

    <p>
        Nowadays, everybody in town knows or knows of Balt, and he rarely goes
        out inside a body anymore.<br>He works in software development, making
        a six-figure salary, and is very generous towards the community around
        him.<br>Legally, he's still considered as "alive", even though he isn't.<br>
        He's thinking of auctioning off or giving away the bodies that were made,<br>
        as he hasn't used any of them in years, opting instead to float around.

            Their metric is based solely on universal constants<br>(e.g. the Planck

        Some species can crossbreed, but the resulting child is very likely

        Words have a maximum radius, on average this is around 30 meters but
        text upward of a few kilometers has been found before

        Words are extremely illegal to have unless you have a special goverment

        It takes an unknown form of energy to create a rule, if a rule
        doesn&rsquo;t have enough then it will not parse

        <ul>

            The more severe the impact of the rule, the more of this energy is
            required

            This is coloquially called entropy, though it&rsquo;s likely not the
